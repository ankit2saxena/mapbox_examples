The older train track underpasses all over the perimeter of the city need to be checked and the graffiti addressed. Former Mayor Tomilea Allison's policy was to paint over all the graffiti at a site like an underpass with gray paint to completely remove any trace of tagging and defacement. She did this as soon as it was reported. This discouraged the vandals knowing that no one would see their dog-like marking of that territory."

The garage is along an alley mid way between East 2nd St and Hunter Ave. I reported it to the Bloomington Police and an officer came, took  statement, and took photos. The case # 3/25/2014-114. I only recently found out from my Elm Heights neighborhood Association that there might be city help to remove the graffiti. Now that the weather is getting warmer, I am hoping that Graffiti Management will help me out. This person also tagged a telephone ground box located midway between 2nd and Hunter."
